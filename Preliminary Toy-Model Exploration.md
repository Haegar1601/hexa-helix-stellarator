Preliminary Toy-Model Exploration (Analytical Field-Line Tracing)To gain initial intuition about the confinement properties of the $N=6$ interlaced geometry, a simplified analytical model was implemented in Python (field-line integration via scipy.odeint, Poincaré sections).Key FindingsStability Threshold: At high perturbation amplitude ($\epsilon \approx 0.05$), significant stochasticity and breakdown of flux surfaces occur, leading to chaotic field-line trajectories.Confinement Recovery: At low amplitude ($\epsilon \approx 0.001$) with mild radial shear, perfectly closed, nested flux surfaces are recovered across all tested radii ($\sigma \approx 0$, unique Poincaré points = 1 per surface).Dynamic Potential: These results suggest the geometry is capable of maintaining high-quality magnetic confinement. The "Breathing Mode" (dynamic phase modulation) is hypothesized to further stabilize these surfaces at higher amplitudes by avoiding static resonance overlaps and actively "healing" magnetic islands.LimitationsVacuum Analytic Model: This exploration uses sinusoidal approximations for the magnetic field components. Higher harmonics arising from complex, discrete 3D coil shapes (as defined in the main project files) are not yet included.No Finite-$\beta$ Effects: The current model does not account for the plasma's self-generated magnetic field or MHD stability/transport analysis.ConclusionThe toy model provides a strong positive signal that the Hexa-Helix geometry is topologically capable of producing stable, closed flux surfaces under appropriate parameter regimes.The critical next step to bridge the "Grounding Gap" remains full 3D MHD validation (e.g., via VMEC or SPEC) using the provided discrete coil data to account for real-world geometry and plasma pressure effects.
