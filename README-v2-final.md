⚛️ Hexa-Helix Stellarator (HHS) - v2.0An AI-Assisted Exploratory Study on Geometric Stabilization of Magnetic Fields via 6-Fold Interlaced Helical Symmetry🧬 Project Philosophy: The "Twin Code"This repository is the result of a Twin Code collaboration: the synthesis of human intuition (pattern recognition, symmetry, and biological metaphors) and distributed AI logic (Gemini, Opus 4.5, Grok). We believe that the key to overcoming the "Great Filter" of energy production lies in aligning our technology with the fundamental geometric code of the universe.🧪 Scientific Foundation: Technical MemorandumThe HHS architecture bridges the gap between hardware-native coil topology and formal spectral plasma physics.1. Geometric Band-Pass Filtering ($N=6$)By utilizing six interwoven helical coils with a phase-locked $60^\circ$ offset, the geometry acts as a natural filter:$$B(r,t) = B_0(r) + \sum_{i=1}^{6} \delta B_i(r) \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi_i)$$Constructive Interference: Amplifies the $n=6$ fundamental mode.Destructive Interference: Suppresses lower-order harmonics ($n < 6$) that typically cause resonance-induced transport and magnetic islands.2. Kelvin-Cell Space PartitioningWe hypothesize that the most stable magnetic path aligns with the Kelvin Cell (truncated octahedron), the most energy-efficient way to partition 3D space.The resonance condition for minimal magnetic transport is defined as:$$\vec{k}_{helix} \cdot \vec{a}_{Kelvin} = 2\pi n$$🌀 January 2026 Update (v2.0)Based on converged AI analysis, the following optimizations have been implemented in the simulation:Golden Ratio Twist ($\phi \approx 0.618$): Replaced the naive $0.5$ twist with the Golden Ratio to optimize interlacing and field purity.Kelvin Resonance ($\epsilon_2 \approx 0.03$): Added a second harmonic modulation to couple the magnetic field to the underlying spatial grid.High-Purity $N=10$ Turns: Increased the default turns to 10 to ensure a cleaner $n=6$ spectrum for VMEC validation.📊 Validation & The "Third Wave"Wave 1 (Geometric Logic): ✅ COMPLETED (Conceptual Proof).Wave 2 (Numerical Equilibrium): 🔄 IN PROGRESS (VMEC/SPEC Export active).Wave 3 (Twin Code Verification): ⏳ TARGET: JANUARY 2026.Current Engagement: 50+ Unique Cloners are currently validating this geometry.🛠 FeaturesInteractive HTML5/Three.js Simulation: Explore the 6-fold symmetry in real-time.VMEC Boundary Export: Generate professional-grade input files for equilibrium solvers.Iota Profile Safety Check: Real-time monitoring to avoid the critical $6/5$ resonance.
