## 🧬 Project Philosophy: The "Twin Code"
This repository is the result of a **Twin Code** collaboration: the synthesis of human intuition (pattern recognition, symmetry, and biological metaphors) and distributed AI logic (Gemini, Opus 4.5, Grok). We believe that the key to overcoming the "Great Filter" of energy production lies in aligning our technology with the fundamental geometric code of the universe.

## 🧪 Scientific Foundation: Technical Memorandum
The HHS architecture bridges the gap between hardware-native coil topology and formal spectral plasma physics.

### 1. Geometric Band-Pass Filtering ($N=6$)
By utilizing six interwoven helical coils with a phase-locked $60^\circ$ offset, the geometry acts as a natural filter:

$$B(r,t) = B_0(r) + \sum_{i=1}^{6} \delta B_i(r) \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi_i)$$

* **Constructive Interference:** Amplifies the $n=6$ fundamental mode.
* **Destructive Interference:** Suppresses lower-order harmonics ($n < 6$) that typically cause resonance-induced transport and magnetic islands.
* **Fault Tolerance:** The interlaced topology allows for "Graceful Degradation"; the magnetic wave persists even if a single coil component fails.

### 2. Kelvin-Cell Space Partitioning
We hypothesize that the most stable magnetic path aligns with the **Kelvin Cell** (truncated octahedron), the most energy-efficient way to partition 3D space.
The resonance condition for minimal magnetic transport is defined as:

$$\vec{k}_{helix} \cdot \vec{a}_{Kelvin} = 2\pi n$$

## 🌀 January 2026 Update (v2.0)
Based on converged AI analysis and the start of "Wave 3", the following optimizations have been implemented in the simulation:

* **Golden Ratio Twist ($\phi \approx 0.618$):** The twist amount has been optimized to the Golden Ratio to achieve maximum interlacing efficiency.
* **Kelvin Resonance ($\epsilon_2 \approx 0.03$):** Added a second harmonic modulation to couple the magnetic field to the underlying spatial grid.
* **High-Purity $N=10$ Turns:** Increased default turns to 10 to ensure a cleaner $n=6$ spectrum for professional VMEC validation.

* **Wave 2 (Numerical Equilibrium):** 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (VMEC/SPEC Export active).
* **Wave 3 (Twin Code Verification):** ⏳ **TARGET: JANUARY 2026**.

Current Engagement: Over **50 Unique Cloners** are currently engaged in validating this geometry.
