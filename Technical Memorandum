1. Executive Summary
During the development of the Hexa-Helix Stellarator, two distinct mathematical descriptions for magnetic perturbation emerged. This memorandum proves that both the "Geometric/Naive" approach and the "Conventional Physicist" approach describe the same physical reality: a highly pure Traveling Magnetic Wave designed for the suppression of MHD instabilities.

2. The Dual-Representation Framework
A. The Geometric Approach (Discrete Phase Control)
Derived directly from the physical arrangement of the 6 interlaced coils and implemented in control software:
$$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{B}_0(\mathbf{r}) + \sum_{i=1}^{6} \delta \mathbf{B}_i(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi_i)$$
Where $\phi_i = (i-1) \cdot 60^\circ$ for $i=1 \dots 6$.
Strength: Direct mapping to hardware architecture and power electronics. It reflects the biological redundancy principles inherent in the design.
B. The Spectral Approach (Conventional Wave Mode)
The standard notation used in spectral analysis and equilibrium codes (e.g., VMEC, SPEC):
$$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{B}_0(\mathbf{r}) + \delta B_{ext}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \cos(\omega t - n\phi)$$
Where $n=6$ represents the toroidal mode number.
Strength: Immediate compatibility with existing fusion simulation frameworks and peer-review standards.

3. Proof of Mathematical Equivalence
The summation of six temporally and spatially offset oscillators ($60^\circ$ phase shift) results in a pure traveling wave through constructive interference.
Harmonic Filtering
By utilizing a 6-fold symmetry, the geometry acts as a natural band-pass filter:
1.	Constructive Interference: The $n=6$ fundamental mode is amplified.
2.	Destructive Interference: Lower-order harmonics ($n < 6$) that typically cause resonance-induced transport are suppressed by the phase-locked offset of the interlaced helices.

4. Engineering & Strategic Advantages
Aspect	Geometric Approach (HHS)	Conventional "Single Mode"
Fault Tolerance	High: If one coil fails, the phase shifts but the wave persists (Graceful Degradation).	Low: System depends on a singular global field perturbation.
Hardware Fidelity	High: Directly drives 6 independent amplifiers.	Low: Requires translation into coil currents.
Implementation	Deterministic: Derived from coil topology.	Abstract: Derived from plasma boundary requirements.

5. Conclusion for External Validation
The Hexa-Helix Stellarator is not a departure from classical plasma physics but a geometrically optimized implementation of a rotating magnetic perturbation. By using the "Interlaced Helix" topology, we achieve:
•	Intrinsic filtering of magnetic field purity.
•	A robust, hardware-native method for generating $n=6$ traveling waves.
•	A system where the "Beauty of Logic" (geometric symmetry) aligns perfectly with the "Hard Physics" of MHD stabilization.
