## 1. Executive Summary
During the development of the Hexa-Helix Stellarator, two distinct mathematical descriptions for magnetic perturbation emerged. This memorandum proves that both the **"Geometric/Naive"** approach (derived from coil topology) and the **"Conventional Physicist"** approach (derived from wave mechanics) describe the same physical reality: a highly pure **Traveling Magnetic Wave** designed for the suppression of MHD instabilities.

## 2. The Dual-Representation Framework

### A. The Geometric Approach (Discrete Phase Control)
Derived directly from the physical arrangement of the 6 interlaced coils and implemented in the control software:

$$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{B}_0(\mathbf{r}) + \sum_{i=1}^{6} \delta \mathbf{B}_i(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \sin(\omega t + \phi_i)$$

*Where $\phi_i = (i-1) \cdot 60^\circ$ for $i=1 \dots 6$.*

**Strength:** Direct mapping to hardware architecture and power electronics. It reflects the biological redundancy principles and the hexagonal symmetry inherent in the design.

### B. The Spectral Approach (Conventional Wave Mode)
The standard notation used in spectral analysis and plasma equilibrium codes (e.g., VMEC, SPEC):

$$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r}, t) = \mathbf{B}_0(\mathbf{r}) + \delta B_{ext}(\mathbf{r}) \cdot \cos(\omega t - n\phi)$$

*Where $n=6$ represents the toroidal mode number.*

**Strength:** Immediate compatibility with existing fusion simulation frameworks and peer-review standards.

## 3. Proof of Mathematical Equivalence
The summation of six temporally and spatially offset oscillators ($60^\circ$ phase shift) results in a pure traveling wave through constructive interference.

### Harmonic Filtering
By utilizing a 6-fold symmetry, the geometry acts as a natural **band-pass filter**:

1.  **Constructive Interference:** The $n=6$ fundamental mode is amplified.
2.  **Destructive Interference:** Lower-order harmonics ($n < 6$) that typically cause resonance-induced transport are suppressed by the phase-locked offset of the interlaced helices.
